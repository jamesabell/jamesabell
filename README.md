ðŸ‘‹ Yo! Iâ€™m James Abell

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m professionally working in the latest Typescript/Javascript and PHP. I know a lot about frontend archetecture and backend architecture. My professional focus has been Vue and Laravel, but know my way around React, Symfony, NestJs and most things around TS/PHP.  

ðŸŒ± I'm always learning. Things like programming microcontrollers, home servers, networking, game development (starting on some VR stuff recently), and love to dive in to any new things that make my ideas come to life.
